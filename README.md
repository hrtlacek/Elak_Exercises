# Python Exercises For Beginners
This is a small collection of python exercises for beginners in python + signal processing.

The simplest way to do these is to just click here:  [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hrtlacek/Elak_Exercises/HEAD?labpath=Exercises_01.ipynb)

*The problem about this is, that you are doing this online in a notebook that will disappear. So your solutions will not be saved. You can download the notebook in the online jupyter evironment after editing. *

If you think you will need more time for this/want to save your solutions: Rather download this repository (The big green button that sais "code" above).
Start your own jupyter lab, navigate to the folder you downloaded and do the exercises in `Exercises_01.ipynb`.


Yes, the Solutions are also in this repository. Why would you look at them before giving the puzzles a go?



## Other Exercise ideas
- Synthesize the 'sound of wind'
- Produce the graph in figure 1.3, page 13 in **'Kleiner, M. (2011). Acoustics and audio technology. J. Ross Publishing'.
- make a max/msp or python program from scratch the calculates the 'zero crossing rate'. Dont use external libraries (other than numpy, or something to load the audio file etc. or to compare with your results)
- Reproduce this in python ('Time-dependent amplitudes' section in wikipedia artcle 'additive synthesis')https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_synthesis#/media/File:Harmonic_additive_synthesis_spectrum.png
- Reproduce a 'blast wave'/'shock wave' in python. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_wave).
